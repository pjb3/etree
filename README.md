etree
=====

This is a port of the [Perl Etree Scripts](http://etree-scripts.sourceforge.net/) to Ruby.  This scripts can be used to download the flac source of audience recording of a concert from a site like [http://bt.etree.org](http://bt.etree.org) or [The Live Music Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/audio) and convert it to mp3s.  Very much a work in progress at this point.
